This package contains the code used for the analysis specific to the tables in the paper.

-Each table has a subfolder (ie. folder Table1 for Table 1 in the paper), 
within each subfolder has the code relevant to the table, 
and a brief readme document that summarizes what the code does.

Supplemental Table 3-4 do not have subfolders since they are written word descriptions to the predictor list or algorithms,

Supplemental Figure 1 also does not have a subfolder since it's a flowchart image not generated by code
