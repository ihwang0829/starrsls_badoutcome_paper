
The R code is used first here to read in the Suicide Death model from another analysis, the risk score is applied to 
the current analysis sample,

then the two SAS codes are used to generate the numbers for Table 5, for four new outcomes:

 -High Risk of Homelessness
 -High Risk of Suicide Attempt
 -High Risk of Suicide Death

 -Unemployment is not included due to low AUCs

 -Table 5 looks at all possible combination of these high risk dummies (only one of them, 2 out of 3, all 3) and 
calculates the % and sensitivity of each
